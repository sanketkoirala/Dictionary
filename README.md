## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
To get started with the Dictionary Web App, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Open the Web App
Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your web browser to access the web app.

## Usage

Using the Dictionary Web App is simple:

1. Open the web app in your browser.

2. Enter the word you want to search for in the input field.

3. Click the "Search" button to initiate the search.

4. The word and its definition will be displayed on the page.

## Code Structure

The web app consists of three main components:

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. It includes a navigation bar, an input field for searching words, and placeholders for displaying the word and its definition.

### JavaScript Logic (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file contains the logic for interacting with the Dictionary API by API Ninja. It makes an API request to fetch word definitions and updates the page with the results.

### CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The CSS file defines the styling for the web app, including the appearance of the input field, button, and overall layout.

## Customization

You can customize the web app by modifying the following files:

- **HTML:** Customize the layout and structure of the web page as needed.

- **JavaScript:** If you want to use a different API or modify the API request logic, you can make changes in the `script.js` file.

- **CSS:** Adjust the styles and appearance of the web app by modifying the `style.css` file.
